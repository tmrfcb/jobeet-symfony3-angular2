symfony3-angular2
=================

A first try to combine Symfony 3 and Angular 2 together, like I already did with [Symfony 2, Angular 1 and Grunt](https://github.com/dsbaars/symfony-angular-grunt).
I started from scratch, mixed some stuff from the [angular 2 quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) with my [angular2-base](https://github.com/dsbaars/angular2-base) project and I got it working.

Why I stopped here
---------------------
I decided to stop here for now because of the following reasons:
- Angular 2 is not yet stable enough
- The guides want to use node_modules for client-side dependencies. I couldn't get `npm` to install to `web/node_modules`.
- I'm not entirely convinced about Typescript and Angular 2 yet
